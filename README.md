AR Markers and AR Planes using AR Foundation, Visual Scripting

What makes a Good AR Markers?
An AR marker must meet the following requirements:
Size must be at least 300 x 300 pixels. (However, markers do not have to be square!).
Format must be PNG or JPG. 
Image must have a strong color value contrast. 
Image should avoid repeated patterns.
Note: AR Foundation does not use color information to detect images, only grayscale, which is why it’s important that markers have good contrast. It’s perfectly fine to have color in your marker for design purposes.
